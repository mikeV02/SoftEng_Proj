# How to connect to Server
Here are several methods to connect to the server.

I have created a subdomain on mu webpage, so we can easily access the server.

~: ssh -i "key file" -L 5901:localhost:5901 ubuntu@softeng.mikedlv.com

# Credentials

localhost::5901

$ofTeng //VNC Connection

YOU NEED TO CONNECT TO SSH BEFORE USING VNC... I added this as someone was trying to access our server with invalid credentials
You can download the following VNC client to connect remotely to the server and work as a Virtual Machine
